O-STARS: Online Students Transgression Accuracy Recording System | IT312: System Integration and Architecture Project

This repository contains the files that compose the O-STARS system. 

    The O-STARS project responds to challenges in implementing Batangas State University's student code of conduct. Despite the code of conduct's significance, student violations often occur due to forgetfulness, impacting academic journeys. Manual record-keeping exacerbates issues, leading to inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and unfairness. To address this, O-STARS proposes an online system for secure, efficient, and transparent record-keeping, targeting the prevalent problem of "Unreliable Record Keeping."

    Focused on digital transformation, the project begins with security guards, aiming to replace the unreliable manual recording of violations with a computerized system. This platform ensures real-time data input, organized storage, and accessibility for authorized individuals, fostering a culture of openness and efficiency in the university's disciplinary system. O-STARS envisions a framework that contributes to maintaining order, promoting fairness, and upholding principles of just and equitable student conduct.
